msgid "Please make sure that the Bible or commentary you selected contains both testaments (OT and NT). Some modules contain only the new testament (e.g. the GerBen  module). If the module has both the problem is probably caused by wrong permissions of the data files. Please set the right permissions of the file and directories.  <p />  The best solution is to create a group called sword and put in this group every user who wants to use  BibleTime  <p />  Now set read-write permissions for the group and change the ownership of every file in the Sword directory to root:sword.  <p />  Execute the following commands to solve the problems:  <p />  <ul>  <li> create a group called sword  </li>  <li> then:  <ul>  <li> cd &lt;your path to SWORD&gt;  </li>  <li> chown root:sword modules mods.d -R  </li>  <li> chmod a+r+X modules/ mods.d/ -R  </li>  <li> chmod g+r+w+X modules/ mods.d/ -R  </li>  <li> chmod u+r+w+X modules/ mods.d/ -R  </li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <p />  These commands set the permission that everybody can read the files, but only the members of the group sword and the owner (root) can write to the files. You need write access for the personal commentary module.  <p />"
