<section><title>Installation of BibleTime</title>
<para>
This page explains how to Install BibleTime on your system. Basically there are two ways to install it: Either by using prebuilt binary packages or by compiling from source code.
We recommend the installation using the binary packages because this is the easiest way.
</para>

	<section><title>Prebuilt binary packages</title>
		<para>We try to provide packages for the most important Linux distributions. These include RedHat, Mandrake and SuSE.
		</para>

		<para>First download the binary package for your Linux distribution. For example: You want to download BibleTime 1.4 for SuSE Linux 9.0. In this case you have to download the package &quot;bibletime-1.4-1.suse9.0.i586.rpm&quot;.
		Please download the package &quot;bibletime-i18n&quot; package, too. This package contains the available translations of the BibleTime user interface and handbook.
		</para>

	<section><title>Compilation from source code</title>
		<para>
		Installation using BibleTime's source code is more difficult than using binary packages. Please follow the steps below if you decided to install BibleTime from sources:

		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				At first make sure the required software is installed on your system.
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<ulink url="http://www.kde.org/">KDE 3</ulink>: At least the libraries and the base package. KDE 3 is shipped with many Linux distributions. Very often it's installed by default.
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<ulink url="http://curl.sourceforge.net/">Curl >= 7.9</ulink>.
