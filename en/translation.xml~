<section><title>Translation in a new language</title>
<para>
If the translation in your language doesn't exist yet, it's easy to do a translation into your language. All you need is to download a text file and translate it. You can download the file here: <ulink url="/en/pot/full.pot">Webpage translation template</ulink>. We recommend to use the program <ulink url="http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/">KBabel</ulink> to translate the file. If you've finished translating it, please send it to <email>info@bibletime.info</email>.
