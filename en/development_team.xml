Together with Thomas Hagedorn and Torsten Uhlmann, I founded the BibleTime

Since I have to finance my
studies, I need to earn some money. Would you like to help me work on
BibleTime instead of something else? Please consider making a
donation, even small amounts will help a lot. I will use them to perform
work on BibleTime (code, docs, administration, sword) at a fixed rate 
per hour. I'll provide reports on how much I worked on BibleTime and 
what I got accomplished during that time. Also, Joachim will check 
my handling of the money.
