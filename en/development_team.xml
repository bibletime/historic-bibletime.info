<formalpara><title>BibleTime involvement:</title>
I have been involved in BibleTime
since 1999. So far I helped with the project administration, the
build system, parts of the code in the backend as well as in the User
Interface of BibleTime, and recently I designed the Install Manager.

<formalpara><title>Support this project member:</title>
Since I have to finance my
studies, I need to earn some money. Would you like to help me work on
BibleTime instead of something else? Please consider making a
donation, even small amounts will help a lot and be used to perform
work on BibleTime (code, docs, administration, sword). I'll provide
reports on how much I worked on BibleTime and what I got accomplished
during that time.

<formalpara><title>Planned tasks:</title>
Revise the Handbook. Test the code
thoroughly and fix remaining bugs. Prepare for the 1.5 release (Sword
1.5.8 release needed).
