<title>Abstract</title>
<para>
The <application>Biblestudy HowTo</application> is a guide for studying the Bible.
</para>
<para>It is the hope of the &bibletime; team that this HowTo will provoke the
readers to study the scriptures to see what they say.  This
particular study guide has been chosen as it takes care not to
advocate any particular denominational doctrine.  We expect you to read
and study the scriptures to understand what they say.  If you start
with the attitude that you want to have the Lord sow his word in your
heart He will not disappoint you.</para>
