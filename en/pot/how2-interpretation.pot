msgid "We already learned about the \"3 Cs\": content, context, cross-reference. We want to expand that now by delving briefly into biblical hermeneutics, whose goal is to discover the meaning intended by the original author (and Author!). While many applications of a passage are valid, only one interpretation is valid. The scripture itself says this by saying that no scripture is of any private interpretation (2 Pe.1:20 KJV <emphasis>\"Knowing this first, that no prophesy of scripture is of any private interpretation.\"</emphasis>) Certain rules are helps toward discovering the correct meaning; by ignoring these rules people have brought much trouble on themselves and their followers. 2 Pe.3:16 <emphasis>\"...in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.\"</emphasis>"

Distinguished from pselaphao (5584), which actually only means to touch the surface of something. \" Now look up \"pim.\" The grammar codes in Zodhiates come right after Revelation; on p. 849 we see that pim stands for \"present imperative active (80)\". On p.857, \"Present Imperative. In the active voice, it may indicate a command to do something in the future which involves continuous or repeated action or, when it is negated, a command to stop doing something. \" This is a negative command, so it is to stop doing something that is already occuring.
