He could quote a comment of the narrator in Genesis 2:24 as an utterance of the Creator Himself (Mt.19:4-5). Similarly He said, 'Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written', when what He went on to quote is the direct speech of the Lord God (Mk.7:6 &amp; Is.29:13). It is from Jesus Himself that the New Testament authors have gained their conviction of the dual authorship of Scripture. For them it was just as true to say that 'God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets' (Heb.1:1) as it was to say that 'men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God' (2 Pe.1:21). God did not speak in such a way as to obliterate the personality of the human authors, nor did men speak in such a way as to corrupt the Word of the divine Author. God spoke. Men spoke.
