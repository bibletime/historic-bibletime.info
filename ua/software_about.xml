>Історія розробки BibleTime</title>
<para
>Ще у червні 1999 року Thomas Hagedorn, Thorsten Uhlmann та Joachim Ansorg розпочали працювати над програмою для вивчення Біблії під KDE 1.0. </para>

<para
>The first version was released two months later as version 0.1. This version was very simple and supported only the most basic things. </para>

<para
>After three months of hard work version 0.2 was released to the public. This version was usable, it supported basic printing, searching and offered a simple editor for personal notes. </para>

<para
>BibleTime 0.2 was later ported to KDE 2 and totally redesigned with a more powerful interface, better printing and a lot of internal changes. This version was called BibleTime 0.3 </para>

<para
>BibleTime 1.0, which was released almost one year after version 0.3 and was the first version we considered as stable. </para>

<para
>BibleTime 1.1 and 1.2 followed later on. BibleTime 1.2 is the first version of BibleTime for version 3.0 of KDE. </para>

>The future of BibleTime</title>
<para
>We're grateful that God supports us and that He blesses our work with new team members. God is good! </para>

<para
>We will continue our work, and as BibleTime improves we'll hopefully reach a point where BibleTime lacks only few things which are useful for a normal Bible study application. </para>
